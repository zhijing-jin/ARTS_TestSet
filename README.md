This is the repository for our 2020 paper 
"[Tasty Burgers, Soggy Fries: Probing Aspect Robustness in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](http://zhijing-jin.com/files/papers/absa2020.pdf)".

### Data
We provide a new test set for SemEval 2014 Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), to test **Aspect Robustness**.
- Original SemEval 2014 datasets can be downloaded [here](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/).
- Our new enriched test sets are at [ARTS_testset](ARTS_testset/)

### How to Use Our Code
If you have a new ABSA dataset, you can run our code. It can generate your own **enriched** test set to probe aspect robustness.
```
python code/main.py
``` 

If you have more questions, please feel free to submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/XINGXIAOYU/ARTS_testset_for_ABSA/issues).
