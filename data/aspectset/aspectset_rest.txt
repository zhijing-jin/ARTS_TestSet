but the staff was so horrible to us
the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora
a very capable kitchen
the food outstanding
the little ' perks ' were great
our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken
usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats
the bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy
nevertheless the food itself is pretty good
forgot our toast
the pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
my suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes
the warm vibe
the owner is super friendly
service is fast
a great concept but a little rough on the delivery

great chinese food
forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food
service could be improved
the heavy , black , antique - seeming teapot , for one
the pizza is delicious
fresh mozzarella
the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese
an excellent place to relax
the food is one of the best in the city of new york
never had a problem walking in and getting a table
a great bistro - type vibe
first off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her odd in a restaurant with 6 tables and got our order wrong
the food was bland oily
the prices are very affordable as well
the food is really good
the fish is fresh
a good bottle of wine
the best bartender
the romantic , alluring ambiance
the five star service
the authentic foods
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience
the space is smaller than most
the best service
i love the atmorphere @ peep
the service was attentive
her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark
the other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious
the environment is romantic
the food is horrible
the service is pathetic
we had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess , it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive
haru 's great food
a tiny space
three tiny white tiled counters
a small counter holding 12 - 14 entrees
the food is great
succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired'doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill
reasonable prices
all conveniently delivered right to the door
even the wine by the glass was good
this dish is my favorite
the change mojito , which was out of this world

the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world
very good service
very good prices
went to this restaurant with some co - workers for lunch and had an amazing time
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive
the best bagel
our food was great too
the most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue
the filet mignon , its just the most tender piece ever
the sake menu should not be overlooked
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8 pm
i 've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good
that the service was slow

the service is ok

staff is very accomodating
small portion
the food was terrific
the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing
try some roti rolls
the food was delivered quickly
quick and friendly service
i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system
try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious
delivery is fast too
the noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
going on with the menu in a positive way
the atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon
odd for ave b , not just odd , the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least
just got back from lunch at tamarind and it was excellent
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised and underdeserving baluchi 's

the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more
the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the peter 's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad

different prices
compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced
amazing cheese
a delicious , new summer menu
an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even
in terms of the food itself -- nothing special
the service was ok
do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full
the staff is accomodating
the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed
the food is out of this world
the food was delicious
the service was top - notch
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group
yummy authentic japanese comfort food
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
the staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces
no attitudes
a great place
largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious
even the pasta is delicious here a rarity in new york pizza restaurants
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business
the best pie
the ingredients taste fresher
the crust is thinner and crispier
the slice is less oily
fish is so very fresh
less wait time
the decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening
i 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino 's blows my families receipies away
different cream cheeses
all of their salads are great
the lobster sandwich is good
the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great
the food was authentic
the prices are quite easy on the wallet
i only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most nyc italian joints i 've tried similar dishes at
the worst excuse for japanese food
the chicken was extremely dry
we had pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing
such lousy service
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good
the award should go to the lobster bisque
either way , both pizzas were really good
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view
making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible
a short wait
the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it
the service is awful
the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience
the sauce was wonderful
the service was very quick and professional
you rarely have to wait for a seat

really cool stauff inside
the same classical furniture

the blond wood decor is very soothing
the premium sake is excellent
the service is great
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere anywhere

the food was absolutely horrible
similar to other indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door
the delicious food
the crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed
not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat
shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20
the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy
way over priced
what i did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered

the manager a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile
a quick lunch
the food was mediocre at best
the horrible service

that much money
the service is excellent
the decor cool and understated
the thai food is good
great taste
definitely not worth the price
traditional french food
it 's easy to get a table for a large group
reasonable prices
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal
the top of view the chart house has to offer

the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant

a very agreeable price
the menu has lots of options
try those potato pancakes
the staff is n't the friendliest or most competent
large portions
the worst dining experience
the great staff
food was okay , nothing great
always popular , always full , always a wait
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq - ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not - so - fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance
their gigantic patio
great portion
the first 2 courses were very good
the chocolate sampler was too rich for me
the dessert wine far too sweet
butter was melted
white wine warm
cheese oozing everywhere
we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning
the place is very cramped
the staff has always been friendly without seeming grating
the eggplant parmesan is also great
no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce
a very fair price
service was very good - prompt , attentive and non - intrusive
my entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner

service is friendly
prices are good
delivery time was a little slow
a good price
the service is excellent

the food is fantastic
the food is tasty
portion sizes are appropriate
your unforgetable sandwich

creative drinks
the fun atmosphere
good food

the decor brings a taste of trendy soho into queens
the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease
the service was excellent
the food was delicious
a crappy scene
annoying customers
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating
beautiful people serving you
the food does n't quite match up
the fillings may be unconventional
the dosa batter is definitely authentic
the perfect spot
the poorly fried tofu
poorly cooked potato
great food
great service
a pleasant atmosphere
their sake martini is wonderful
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny
a wonderful dining experience
found service above average
bagels are ok
fine dining restaurant quality
overall a disappointing experience for that price category

terrible sauce
a good meal

the red curry is weak and tasteless
the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy

recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food
it is nearly impossible to get a table

the puke green walls leave a lot to be desired
the flavors are very fresh and pretty unobtrusive , nothing flashy
the people who work there are evil and incompetent

our son loves pizza
good lunch food
i liked the food at this quasi - thai restaurant
the best salad

you hearty and hot bagels
the barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry
so , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious
the highly spiced chai tea was great too
food is good and consistent
the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these
lacking in ambiance
the best decor
a casual atmosphere

the comforting atmosphere
standard brassiere food , better then places like balthazar etc
slipped in quality
the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth
excellent service
the large amounts of food
the amiable atmosphere
the service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server
this small place is packed
