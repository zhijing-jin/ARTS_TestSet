the good battery life
high quality
a killer gui
very good applications
is easy to use
many great features
no gui
screen all dark
a soft rubber enclosure
an external mouse unnecessary
i love the way the entire suite of software works together
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied
windows 7 is great
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly
the system crashed
painless syncing
extend my screen
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours
the newer features
realized its a problem with this brand
also kinda loud when the fan was running
be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads
drivers updated ok
speaking of the browser , it too has problems
the keyboard is too slick
it 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open
still under warrenty so called toshiba , no help at all
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine
a month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died
the system it comes with does not work properly
new hardware
if a website ever freezes which is rare , its really easy to force quit
it rarely works
it runs a lot faster
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble
the performace increase
took way too long to do simple things , like opening my documents folder
the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me
high speed
i love the glass touchpad
the hardware screwed up , not able to connect
the expensive shipping
everything is so easy to use
and if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key
its ease of use
the top service
the battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it
enabling the battery timer is useless
temperatures on the outside were alright
purchase virus protection for mac , which saves me a lot of time and money
but we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none
responds well
hardware replaced after only 2 months
replace the motherboard in april
was pretty self explantory in use
a very badly designed system
i love windows 7 which is a vast improvment over vista
keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do
dell 's customer disservice is an insult to it 's customers who pay good money for shoddy products
the very knowledgeable sales associate
you really want a bang - up system and do n't need to run windows applications , go with an apple
some inefficient virus program
it 's color is even cool
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed
the keyboard feels good
the white mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying
the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag
stuck all of the time you use it
lots of preloaded software
i wish it had a webcam though
a bigger screen
the battery life is excellent
one drawback , i wish the keys were backlit
the volume could be louder
the mouse did nt break after only a month
the touchpad is very responsive
in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker
completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours
from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy
after i install mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it
the delivery was fast
such a small amount of memory
it 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office
a bad connector
works well
mostly i love the drag and drop feature
the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed
saved me the sales tax i would have incurred buying locally
several great software packages
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro , the monitor has completely died
the brand of itunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that apple started it all
13 is small especially for a desktop replacement but with an external monitor , who cares
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp
the amd turin processor seems to always perform so much better than intel
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints
the screen is bright
the keyboard is nice
ilife is great
i love snow leopard x.
i thought learning the mac os would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc
it is easy to use and lightweight
a longer service life
the above missing ports
a great price
a sleek look
chiclet type keys
the stock screen - which is very glossy
the gray color was a good choice
like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front
heavy computing
the magnetic plug - in power charging power cord is great i even put it to the test by accident - excellent innovation
great graphics
is easy to use , fast
their support is great
only good thing is the graphics quality
the browser useless
the keyboard being farther back than usual
the problems with their warrentys
now my cd drive was n't reading anything
was n't running right
this computer does n't do that well with certain games it ca n't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games
the most important features
the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up
great netbook , low price
the video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it
a portable mouse which would be way cheaper
no cooling pad needed
great feature
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use
the quality it provides is great
its long battery life
blazing speed
a handy music - management program
helpful , english speaking from vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me
run my adobe creative apps efficiently
esay to use
a power supply problem
sacrificing size
out of warranty
windows xp sp2 caused many problems on the computer
my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall
awesome graphics
assuring security
the audio problem
the keyboard does n't light up on this model
it runs perfectly
the laptop was very easy to set up
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer
only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth
it meets it 's spec quite easily
fairly new graphics chip
they use higher - quality components that are faster , better - configured , and end up lasting a lot longer
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports
nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it
that system is fixed
ran smoothly
the brand is tarnished in my heart
poor grounding and isolation between the components
better product quality
out of warranty
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp
maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be
the price is higher then dell laptops
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations
a nice twin packing
all the functions works great
the laptops / mobile phones look chic and cool
i hate the display screen
like the acer arcade
needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion
no cd drive
it runs very quiet too which is a plus
a major design flaw
heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size
an amazing life spanned an electronic
a great value
very few problems with system performance
a mac is very easy to use
it is so much easier to use
the necessary virus protection
the unique way that apple osx 16 functions
a new intel core processors and hdmi port
the price premium is a little much
when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash
how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket
is useful for time machine
i like the extra features
i love the windows 7 home premium
the battery life was shorter than expected
the keyboard is top notch
its not compatable with the software
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc
the image is great
the soud is excelent
it was very easy to just pick up and use
it cost , very good investment
upgrading from windows 7 starter , thru windows 7 home premium , to windows 7 professional was a snap
the awesome new multi - touch features
the screen is a little glary
i hated the clicking buttons
not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing
the hardware problems
excellent battery life
apple care included
it run way to slow
windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs
the little battery
i liked the aluminum body
stops working out of no were
a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax
great value for the price
now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months
also , the extended warranty was a problem
runs great
lightweight and the screen is beautiful
did n't work
out of warranty
less tech issues
the size is perfect
the limited space
the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty
many higher priced computers
recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because that s the only thing i really care about
great colors
the price will stay the same for the next year
the 17 inch screen is very large
their horrible support
the bluetooth to work properly
liked the glass screen
the switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it
they did n't offer any technical support
it is overload with updates the boot mgr
if that s not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too
the mouse buttons are hard to push
hdd secures inside using rails
it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap vaio
games being the main issue
invalidate the warranty on the hard drive i do n't really understand why but anyway
light home use
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies
it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows
the battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it
long battery life
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop
the nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year
a stronger more resilient frame
came fully loaded - good
a new system called windows 7
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is
an ergonomic design
like at least a 4 hr . battery life
sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to
wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned
their short battery life
the many background programs
a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography
such a great price
the left mouse key broke
good speed
plenty of hard drive space
very long - life battery up to 10 - 11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings
screen is awesome
battery life is good
a very nice seamless appearance
the technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother
the graphics were awful
the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer
a malfunction in the battery itself
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy
it is definitely amazing for gaming
good use
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed
somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot
the driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating
work worth a damn
it works really well
better graphics card
the built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd'd during that time
it works fine with our wireless
product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
the computer is very easy to use
the casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it
a great price
the full software
free future updates
and the multiple page viewer allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online
out of warranty
wonderful features
such great features
i like those programs better than office
only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen froze again
it is not ideal for children because of the temp
windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems
adding the thunderbolt port
the lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months
images are crisp and clean
its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks
been very satisfied with its performance
the computer runs very fast with no problems
the system board failed

increases the bulk
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful
great value
cracks in the screen hinges
plenty of storage with 250 gb
problems with the nvidia chipset " -inquired status of repair
programs would crash all the time
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the macbook pro
reasonable size
fan noise
the fan made a constant hissing noise in the background
the screen is bright and clear
the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice
a .1 ghz faster processor
the feature are good enough for what i need
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support
noticed the issue with dvds or other media , only through usb output
with windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must
very good quality
a dedicated video card
the full sized touch pad
using an external mouse for convenience
was super easy to set up
the only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set
its a good laptop for its value
then the hard drive failed
runs great
loads fast
of course my warranty runs out next month
found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access
a great value
ran great
the battery has never worked well
how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company
a lack of screen resolutions
small enough to use on a long flight , light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips
the sharp edges
many great programs
it is very well built
great performance
the screen resolution was exactly what i was looking for
an antiquated cpu
thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel
if upgrade is possible to the full windows 7 , then i will truly be a very happy geek
the regular layout keyboard is so much better
runs fast
all the programs are easy and straight forward on my macbook pro
windows 7 starter is terrific no you ca n't change the background
support has been lackluster
" > iphoto is probably the best program i have ever worked with : easy and convenient

the toshiba net book operates very well
the pictures are clear as can be
transporting this computer very easy
it 's wonderful for computer gaming
a free printer
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x.
the worlds very worst repair service
runs faster than an average pc
it was past warrenty
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare
all the features that are necessary for college
already the mouse button has broke
poor performance
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again
junk programs
lots of extra space
the keyboard is ridiculously small
it 's so bad that i 'm thinking i only got half a battery or something
long battery life
largest hard drive
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it
looks great to boot
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac
the laptop runs just as fast as the first day i bought it
a great price
was poor quality
poor performance
great battery life
a good , easy to use first laptop
sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer
great battery life
a low , low price
delivery was early too
's also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing
a faster processor
more ram
a better battery
this one was very well designed
that stupid bluetooth mouse
more trendy , high tech features
keyboard is great
primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable
it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into
faster system memory
the speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish
the perfect size
my real problem with it ? the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie
the battery life is also relatively good
suggest getting an extended warranty
stupid pop up windows
best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down
memory is upgradable
the large screen
their customer service was lacking
the plug in the computer come loose
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one
the new great looking design
i love the keyboard
a great program
much better speakers
as easy as it is to use
bad customer services
also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it
an excellent program
a great performing machine
the repair depot stinks
no cd drive
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me
keys stick periodically
like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad
like the gaming look
it 's hard drive replaced
a higher cost
the only downfall is the volume control
very fast boot up
the right price
internet connectivity is important
recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a usb wireless card
sound problems
it discharges too quickly
the compatibility issues
then it ceased charging at all
one very large heat sink
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest
wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not
the pricing is very competitive
on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black
i am unable to install and uninstall some programs
the screen is bright and vivid

go through the tutorials patiently
it runs its amazing
keyboard could use some trimming
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes
buttons not working
usb ports inoperative
the letter a stopped working after the first week
junk software
with what i do know how to do , the computer works beautiful
a really high quality
when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you do n't matter
however the frozen screens kept happening
it is short on space
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things
runs smooth and quick
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something i 'd stare at for the entire 10 - 11 hours of battery life five days a week
the graphics are great
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse
the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc
for the [ $ ] price special offer this is a great laptop
run well without having to purchase additional memory
the battery life is great
a serious gaming laptop
nothing to complain about the system
the new osx
new features
the use more easy
now the screen is going darker , darker , darker
the battery was faulty
i previously purchased a 13 " macbook had pro specs and was aluminum style which had a nvidia 9800 if i am not mistaken and it had major heating issues
it 's so easy to carry
the old word processer which works good
the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel
these features were standard
it over heated and the touch - mouse stopped responding
no numeric pad
poor construction quality
but the arm velcro is torn after one use
the software is amazing
hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just " slide " downwards
the battery life is amazing
the versitility is outstanding
vista is a nightmare
the program came with the computer and works beautifully
new browsers
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it
charger seems large for this class of computer
i dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers
it does not affect performance at all
the unibody design is edgy and durable
less than a week after my one - year warranty was up
but , for the cost this is a winner
also , the battery does not last very long at all
as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed
strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers
the fan blade fell apart
a bad internet connection
macs are just pretty to look at
my macbook is so much better looking and so thin
the ease of use is wonderful
the battery gets so hot it is scary
the keys are easy to type with
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys
all its so called advanced features
no mute
better color reproduction
the warranty was still valid
it is easy to use
much more features which are so cool
excellent proprietary software
getting the apple care plan is a must
recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive
a faster processor
more memory
a bigger hard drive
a better quality web cam
nicer screen
many other features
the only downfall is the battery only last 1.5 - 2.0 hrs when not plugged in
the graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid
the short battery life
lack of a webcam
graphics are clean and sharp
internet interfaces are seamless
the newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook
sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst
useless applications
its office compatible
works flawlessly
i 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it that 's about how long the port seems to last
also the battery is completely shot

no instructions
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor
good value
well built
works easily right out of the box
screen is crystal clear
the system is very responsive
it is easy to operate

the easy to see screen
it works well for work , persoal or just play
a more comfortable edge
one drawback i noticed was sound quality via usb
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased
an older operating system
i'ts nice to have the higher - end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features i need
known motherboard problems
also the speakers are not very loud
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect
eventually my battery would n't charge
my first problem was with the pre - loaded norton firewall / security program
i had a usb connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible
the hard drive crashed
once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers
i love the multi - touch trackpad
cost more than the netbook new
not too much " junk " software to remove
loosing about 20 % of performance because of that
good quality
good price
more ram
the hard drive crashed as well
another issue i have with it is the battery
the right power supply
the extra sony sonic stage software
my macbook pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter
the battery life is amazing
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming
a great price
not easy to carry
the programs that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " service center "
the material this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs
the lowest price
the large multi - touch track pad is amazing
more hard disk space
taught me never to trust an internal hard disk
easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere
many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers
high quality videos and movies and gaming
plenty of space
out of the blue the power adapter stops working
of course , for a student , weight is always an issue
now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one
2.the wireless card is low quality

the best warranty
the sound is nt very loud i have to wear headphones
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system , but you will learn fast and its all worth it

it is super easy to use
many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac

the speakers on it are useless too
battery is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos
iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites
supposed to be fixed , by a " senior tech
a cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " product
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with
my particular battery
the battery life is too short
the case is coming apart
my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly
the system constantly overheats
sent me a whole new cord overnight
it 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks
a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines
the rep did not even answer my question , i had to ask him , if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc
for me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well

little short on ram
it did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media
for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product
the warranty expired
i was ready for a change and tired of the windows system

great screen quality
great graphics
the built - in webcam is great for skype and similar video - chat services

a large battery life
such a lovely screen
a reasonable price
the worst batteries possible
the speed is fine

tech support is not available 24/7
the backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark
a large screen big enough to please anyone
my safari internet browser is freaking out on me
everything about the mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use
the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying
a good working microphone
it performs flawlessly
the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the ibook
a bad shipment
such as quicklook which save heaps of time
blown away by all the features this laptop offers
the keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past
its simple yet stylish design
fantastic colors
first the screen goes completely out
a great program
it takes very good pictures with the built - in camera

i use a cooling pad but it does n't help
the software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what windows comes with
i 'm tired of the inept service
shipped very quickly
the kernal is missing , or corrupt
the display on this computer is the best i 've seen in a very long time
but the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop
in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced
with the upgraded memory , the macbook pro never has an issue running many many applications at once
great graphics
the internet speed is spectacular
call center is still down
my husband uses it mostly for games , email and music
the broken cords
sharp edges
the screen is gorgeous - yummy good
my disc drive refused to open
so , after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely
the suspicious power supply problem
a fantastic display
starts fast
the hinge tightened
replace the connection card in may
browsing , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes which usually slows down my pc
decent comp for the price
a down right awful setup
replace his entire motherboard
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily
the ease of set up was terrific
the battery is so awesome
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment
first , it does not have a push button to open the lid
a special interface device
another included program that is laughable is the chess game
the expese was a little much
the price was very good
the product is top quality
played various games without problems
ran aero smoothly and flawlessly
the screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze
from the get - go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation
a big enough screen
a great webcam
skype works very well
the solid machined aluminum frame
the keyboard is the best of any laptop i 've used
run a parallels type program easily
daily nice compact design
that a intel built - in card would have trouble with
some slightly older games
i preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
the screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop
how awful it is to use
the right speaker did not work
dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture
the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy
the computer runs extremely slowly , whether opening word or my computer
the mac snow leopard o / s is extremely easy to use , although very different than win xp , visa or win7
the screen is nice
super fast processor
really nice graphics card
a great size
the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade
the wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time
i can not be happier with the service or product
the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well
speakers does n't sound that great
i love windows 7
get serious about ergonomics
required connections less obtrusive
i pushed the power plug in too hard
quality gaming
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning
the ac power port becomes loose over time
a better running system
there are no gold key numbers too intall programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time
is great i am running vista business
it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around
the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day
an ease to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer
the battery is irreplaceable
protected by norton
the internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used
the command prompt would not work at all
finally the hard drive went out
speakers too small to be of any real use
i upgraded it 's ram to 2 gb , i am very happy with it
more memory
vista would run slowly
battery life could be better
overall for the price and toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace
the windows 7 starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics
cluttered and confusing desktop icons
the apple care has never failed me
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work
the mouse is way way way too sensitive
run flawlessly
also , i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me
delivery service was slow
ease of use
the i3 processor does n't seem to run hot
the fan rarely turns on
just a normal operating system
the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as yahoo ! mail
to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 " laptop does
the battery life is excellent
the screen brightness automatically adjusts
like the backlit keyboard
the great look
the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones
the buttons you have to press a little harder than most
crank up the brightness
while it was highly rated , would i like it ? i tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok
a more expensive , long - lasting laptop of quality like a sony , apple , or toshiba
high performance
surf the web a whole lot faster than before
a detailed hardcopy manuel
a non - functioning drive
great visual
priced very reasonable
works very well right out of the box
the keyboard itself is alright
makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons
so many wonderful features and benefits
blazing speeds
the touch pad does nt work like it should all the time
great size
fantastic features
easy mouse pad
for some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system
the trackpad was easy to learn and navigate
applications open in seconds
lose the data on my hard drive
it could not load windows so i contacted acer to get it fixed thru my warrenty
the keyboard larger
its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general
just enough ram
enough memory
the issue is with the nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return
did not work after 2 days
the resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market
then just the other day , my left " mouse " button snapped
the keyboard is lighted
the added feature
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior
remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro
they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a mac
is able to connect to an hdmi
the graphics are awful
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook
they shipped it to the incorrect address
i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better
it is so simple to use
some hardware defects
since i bought my mac , i wo n't ever go back to any windows
no cost
the applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer i have ever owned
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room
great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household
the only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but i expected that
their hinges are tighter
all necessary basic programs
an improvement in customer service
all of the programs keynote , pages , numbers have an option to save your documents as microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual
the initial out of pocket expense is greater
u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems
no cd drive
unfortunately , apple 's quality has continued to slide
the pointer will not even move
free shipping
the best price
a short life span
the my toshiba feature is wonderfull
the layout of the macbook is horrible and confusing
was not happy with one of the programs on it
a reliable , easy to use computer
usb did n't work the third sent
iwork is cheap compared to office
if you are using this for document creation apple does nt provide any kind of word processor such as works for windows
it is light and the battery last a very long time
rubbing off the button below the mouse pad
the screen has a terrible glare
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work
the touchpad is extremely sensitive , which is the only drawback
very useful applications
the best photo application
the big screen
my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a windows update
windows problems
the graphics are stunning
a decent enough system
after much effort and 10 days asus replaced itthe wifi is very weak
more software to fix it
it is easy to navigate and update programs
